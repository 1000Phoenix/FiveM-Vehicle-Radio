# Custom Radio Script for FiveM.

## Description
A customizable radio script to replace the default radial wheel. This script allows players to select radio stations and play YouTube videos directly from the in-game UI.

## Installation
1. Ensure [xSound](https://github.com/Xogy/xsound) is installed.
2. Add to your `resources` folder and ensure it as you would any other script.

### Technically optional
3. Replace `RADIO_CUSTOM.png` in `html/images` to your custom radio station, a server logo or anything else. 
4. Replace `"Radio Custom"` in line 23 of `client/lua` to whatever your custom station is called, or leave it if you don't have one.
